This is BladeChat. A lightweight browser chat powered by Javascript.

No login, No Passwords, No Saved Chats

BladeChat has a simple interface. Each user is given a Blade id and can connect to other Blade users by sharing ids. 
The system is hosted on the users computers meaning no chance of server corruption. 

Users can share documents and images with the build in file transferer. When the page is closed, the chat history is gone.
Never have chats been this secure and anonymous.
